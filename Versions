usb Wicreds OUTDATED - Use sWARE much better.

email Wicreds:
  Takes wifi creds with admin cmd not using any software leaving basically no evidence. Slow but emails it to your.
  
usb Wicreds:
  Just like the emial version. Doesn't use any software and uses admin cmd. This one saves to usb. Outdated and will probaly not be updated.

sWARE Wicreds:
  Uses a software to take wifi creds. SUPER FAST!!!! Might be virus detected though. Also uses admin bypass if not deteced. Better becuase fo its speed.
